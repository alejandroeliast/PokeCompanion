# PokeCompanion

### Description
A companion app for the fanmade tabletop RPG game Pokerole. Currently, it is able to show all the possible characters in a list for ease of access. Filters were created to let users sort through the list easily and quickly get the information they need. The ability to create, use and delete folders is being worked on to let users create and save a set of characters to revisit later. 

Working in this project, I was able to focus on the functionality, programming and UI & UX design of the application. The project taught me how to work with larger amounts of data and how to pull that data from spreadsheets to make use of them. Creating Scriptable Objects using the compiled information, made it easy to call and display information when needed.
